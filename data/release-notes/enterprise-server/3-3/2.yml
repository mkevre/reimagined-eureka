  bugs:
    - Actions self hosted runners would fail to self-update or run new jobs after upgrading from an older GHES installation.
    - Storage settings could not be validated when configuring MinIO as blob storage for GitHub Packages.
    - GitHub Actions storage settings could not be validated and saved in the Management Console when "Force Path Style" was selected.
    - Actions would be left in a stopped state after an update with maintenance mode set.
    - Running `ghe-config-apply` could sometimes fail because of permission issues in `/data/user/tmp/pages`.
    - The save button in management console was unreachable by scrolling in lower resolution browsers.
    - IOPS and Storage Traffic monitoring graphs were not updating after collectd version upgrade.
    - Some webhook related jobs could generated large amount of logs.
    - A Billing navigation item was visible in the site admin pages.
    - Several documentation links resulted in a 404 Not Found error.
  known_issues:
    - After upgrading to {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.3, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} may fail to start automatically. To resolve this issue, connect to the appliance via SSH and run the `ghe-actions-start` command.
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository, where the blob's file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - The {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} npm registry no longer returns a time value in metadata responses. This was done to allow for substantial performance improvements. We continue to have all the data necessary to return a time value as part of the metadata response and will resume returning this value in the future once we have solved the existing performance issues.
    - Resource limits that are specific to processing pre-receive hooks may cause some pre-receive hooks to fail.
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} storage settings cannot be validated and saved in the {% data variables.enterprise.management_console %} when "Force Path Style" is selected, and must instead be configured with the `ghe-actions-precheck` command line utility.'
