For a specific job, you can use `jobs.<job_id>.permissions` to modify the default permissions granted to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. For more information, see "[Authentication in a workflow](/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#permissions-for-the-github_token)."

By specifying the permission within a job definition, you can configure a different set of permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for each job, if required. Alternatively, you can specify the permissions for all jobs in the workflow. For information on defining permissions at the workflow level, see [`permissions`](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions).

#### Example: Setting permissions for a specific job

This example shows permissions being set for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that will only apply to the job named `stale`. Write access is granted for the `issues` and `pull-requests` scopes. All other scopes will have no access.

```yaml
jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v3
```
