Use `jobs.<job_id>.container` to create a container to run any steps in a job that don't already specify a container. If you have steps that use both script and container actions, the container actions will run as sibling containers on the same network with the same volume mounts.

If you do not set a `container`, all steps will run directly on the host specified by `runs-on` unless a step refers to an action configured to run in a container.

### Example: Running a job within a container

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    container:
      image: node:14.16
      env:
        NODE_ENV: development
      ports:
        - 80
      volumes:
        - my_docker_volume:/volume_mount
      options: --cpus 1
```

When you only specify a container image, you can omit the `image` keyword.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    container: node:14.16
```
