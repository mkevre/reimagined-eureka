When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be `pending`. Any previously pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled. To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify `cancel-in-progress: true`.

### Examples: Using concurrency and the default behavior

{% raw %}
```yaml
concurrency: staging_environment
```
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
```yaml
concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}
```
{% endraw %}

### Example: Using concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run

{% raw %}
```yaml
concurrency: 
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
{% endraw %}

### Example: Using a fallback value

If you build the group name with a property that is only defined for specific events, you can use a fallback value. For example, `github.head_ref` is only defined on `pull_request` events. If your workflow responds to other events in addition to `pull_request` events, you will need to provide a fallback to avoid a syntax error. The following concurrency group cancels in-progress jobs or runs on `pull_request` events only; if `github.head_ref` is undefined, the concurrency group will fallback to the run ID, which is guaranteed to be both unique and defined for the run.

{% raw %}
```yaml
concurrency: 
  group: ${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
{% endraw %}


### Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs or runs for the current workflow

 If you have multiple workflows in the same repository, concurrency group names must be unique across workflows to avoid canceling in-progress jobs or runs from other workflows. Otherwise, any previously in-progress or pending job will be canceled, regardless of the workflow.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow, you can use the `github.workflow` property to build the concurrency group:

{% raw %}
```yaml
concurrency: 
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
{% endraw %}
