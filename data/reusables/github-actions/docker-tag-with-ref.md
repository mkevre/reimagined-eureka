The above workflow checks out the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository, uses the `login-action` to log in to the registry, and then uses the `build-push-action` action to build and push the Docker image. It tags the built Docker image with the Git reference of the workflow event. This workflow is triggered on publishing a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} release, so the reference will be the Git tag for the release.
