## View enterprise owners and their roles in an organization

If your organization is managed by an enterprise account, then you can view the enterprise owners who manage billing settings and policies for all of your enterprise's organizations. For more information about enterprise accounts, see "[Types of {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} accounts](/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts)."

You can also view whether an enterprise owner has a specific role in the organization. Enterprise owners can also be an organization member, any other organization role, or be un-affililated with the organization.

{% note %}

**Note:** If you're an organization owner, you can also invite an enterprise owner to have a role in the organization. If an enterprise owner accepts the invitation, a seat or license in the organization is used from the available licenses for your enterprise. For more information about how licensing works, see "[Roles in an enterprise](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#enterprise-owner)."
