## About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} access to internal repositories

If your organization is owned by an enterprise account, you can share actions and workflows within your enterprise, without publishing the action or workflow publicly, by allowing {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflows to access an internal repository that contains the action or workflow.

Any actions or workflows stored in the internal repository can be used in workflows defined in other private and internal repositories owned by the same organization, or by any organization owned by the enterprise. Actions and workflows stored in internal repositories cannot be used in public repositories.
