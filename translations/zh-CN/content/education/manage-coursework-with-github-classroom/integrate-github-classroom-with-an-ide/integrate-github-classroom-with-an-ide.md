We know cloud IDE integrations are important to your classroom and are working to bring more options.

## Configuring an IDE for an assignment

You can choose the IDE you'd like to use for an assignment when you create an assignment. To learn how to create a new assignment that uses an IDE, see "[Create an individual assignment](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment)" or "[Create a group assignment](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/create-a-group-assignment)."

## Authorizing the OAuth app for an IDE

The first time you configure an assignment with an IDE, you must authorize the OAuth app for the IDE for your organization.

对于所有仓库，授予应用程序**读取**元数据、管理和代码的权限，以及**写入**问管理和代码的权限。 更多信息请参阅“[授权 OAuth 应用程序](/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-oauth-apps)”。
