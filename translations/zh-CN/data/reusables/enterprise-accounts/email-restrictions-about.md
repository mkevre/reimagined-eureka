When you restrict email notifications, enterprise members can only use an email address in a verified or approved domain to receive email notifications about activity in organizations owned by your enterprise account.

{% data reusables.enterprise-accounts.approved-domains-beta-note %}

可以从企业帐户继承域，也可以为特定组织配置域。 For more information, see "[Verifying or approving a domain for your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise/verifying-or-approving-a-domain-for-your-enterprise-account)" and "[Restricting email notifications for your organization](/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/restricting-email-notifications-for-your-organization)."

{% data reusables.notifications.email-restrictions-verification %}

如果对企业帐户启用了电子邮件限制，则组织所有者无法禁用该企业帐户拥有的任何组织的电子邮件限制。 If changes occur that result in an organization having no verified or approved domains, either inherited from an enterprise account that owns the organization or for the specific organization, email restrictions will be disabled for the organization.
