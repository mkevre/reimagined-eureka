To automatically trigger a workflow, use `on` to define which events can cause the workflow to run. 有关可用事件的列表，请参阅“[触发工作流程的事件](/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows)”。

You can define single or multiple events that can a trigger workflow, or set a time schedule. You can also restrict the execution of a workflow to only occur for specific files, tags, or branch changes. 以下各节介绍了这些选项。
