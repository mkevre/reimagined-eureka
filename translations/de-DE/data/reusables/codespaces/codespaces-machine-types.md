You can run your codespace on a choice of three types of remote machine: Basic, Standard, or Premium. Each of these has a different level of resources and a different billing tier.<!-- For information, see "\[About billing for Codespaces\](/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces)." -->{% note %}

**Note:** {% data reusables.codespaces.about-billing-for-codespaces %}

Switching machine types gives you the flexibility to choose the most appropriate resources for your work. Certain tasks may require different machine types:

* **Basic** for updating a file and raising a pull request
* **Standard** for editing a website
* **Premium** for high compute tasks such as data analysis
