#### Overview of package permissions and visibility

|                    |        |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Permissions        | {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}The permissions for a package are either inherited from the repository where the package is hosted or, for packages in the {% data variables.product.prodname_capitalized_container_registry %}, they can be defined for specific user or organization accounts. For more information, see "[Configuring a packageâ€™s access control and visibility](/packages/learn-github-packages/configuring-a-packages-access-control-and-visibility)." {% else %}Each package inherits the permissions of the repository where the package is hosted. <br> <br> For example, anyone with read permissions for a repository can install a package as a dependency in a project, and anyone with write permissions can publish a new package version.{% endif %} |
| Visibility         | {% data reusables.package_registry.public-or-private-packages %} |
