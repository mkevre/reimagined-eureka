You can export information about members in your organization. This is useful if you want to perform an audit of users within the organization.

The exported information includes:
- Username and display name details
- Whether the user has two-factor authentication enabled
- Whether the membership is public or private
- Whether the user is an organization owner or member
- Datetime of the user's last activity (for a full list of relevant activity, see "[Managing dormant users](/admin/user-management/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-dormant-users)")
- The user's SAML NameID, if available

You can get member information directly from the {% data variables.product.product_name %} user interface, or using APIs. This article explains how to obtain member information from within {% data variables.product.product_name %}.

For more information about the APIs, see our [GraphQL API](/graphql/reference/objects#user) and [REST API](/rest/reference/users) documentation about users.
