name: Remove stale staging resources

# **What it does**:
# This cleans up any rogue staging applications and environments that outlasted
# the closure of their corresponding pull requests.
# **Why we have it**:
# Staging applications and environments should be destroyed after their
# corresponding pull request is closed or merged, especially to save money spent
# on Heroku App staging deployments for closed PRs.
# **Who does it impact**:
# Anyone with a closed, spammy, or deleted pull request in docs or docs-internal.
